English Wikipedia article search engine. Engine uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to remove noise from the initial matrix and multiplies it by IDF (inverse document frequency) to lower the significance of common words in the text. The current model includes articles from the following categories:

- Computing
- Fields_of_mathematics
- Physics
- Religion
